# SetHome plugin for PaperMC

My first PaperMC plugin. Trying some stuff out.
With this plugin you will be able to set your home and teleport to it.

## Commands

```
/sethome #set current location as home point
/home #teleport to your home
```

## Development

Create a new folder called `test-server` for your PaperMC server.  
The gradle build script will automatically copy the generated jar to the `plugin` folder. Just restart your server and test out the JAR.
